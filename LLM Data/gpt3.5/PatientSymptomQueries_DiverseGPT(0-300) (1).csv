Surgery can help stabilize your foot and ankle joints and remove bony areas to prevent foot ulcers. | Protective footwear --Â Once your foot has healed, your provider may suggest footwear to help support your foot and prevent re-injury. These may include: | Ongoing monitoring --Â You will need to see your provider for checkups and take steps to protect your feet for the rest of your life. | You will have new casts placed on your foot as the swelling comes down. Healing can take a couple of months or more. | Immobilization --Â Your provider will have you wear a total contact cast. This will help limit movement of your foot and ankle. You will likely be asked to keep your weight off your foot entirely, so you will need to use crutches, a knee-walker device, or wheelchair. | The goal of treatment is to stop bone loss, allow bones to heal, and prevent bones from moving out of place (deformity). | Activity changes --Â You will always be at risk for Charcot foot coming back or developing in your other foot.

- Normally, a child inherits 1 pair of sex chromosomes, one X from the mother and one X or one Y from the father.
- A baby with an X chromosome from the father is a genetic female (2 X chromosomes), while a baby with a Y chromosome from the father is a genetic male (1 X and 1 Y chromosome).
- Klinefelter syndrome occurs randomly and is not inherited.

- Anemia caused by low iron levels is the most common form of anemia, obtained through certain foods and old red blood cells.
- Toddlers who consume excessive cow's milk may become anemic as it hinders iron absorption and may lead to a lack of iron-rich foods in their diet.
- Inadequate iron in the diet is a common cause of anemia in children, especially during rapid growth phases like puberty.
- Poor iron absorption despite sufficient iron intake.
- Slow blood loss over a prolonged period, often from menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive tract.","1. ""I've been feeling really tired lately, even when I get enough sleep. I also have this constant headache that just won't go away.""

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000431.htm,Rheumatoid arthritis,"NUTRITION | Other therapies that may help ease joint pain include: | Biologic DMARD agents -- These medicines are designed to affect parts of the immune system that play a role in the disease process of RA. | Surgery may be needed to correct severely damaged joints. Surgery may include: | Anti-inflammatory medicines: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen and celecoxib. | MEDICINES | Biologic and synthetic agents can be very helpful in treating RA. However, people taking these medicines must be watched closely because of uncommon, but serious adverse reactions: | Early treatment for RA with medicines called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be used in all patients. This will slow joint destruction and prevent deformities. The activity of the RA should be checked at regular visits to make sure the disease is under control. The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the RA. | Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These are often the medicines that are tried first in people with RA. They are prescribed along with rest, strengthening exercise, and anti-inflammatory drugs. | PHYSICAL THERAPY | Range-of-motion exercises and exercise programs prescribed by a physical therapist can delay the loss of joint function and help keep muscles strong. | SURGERY | Corticosteroids -- These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects and do not prevent joint damage if used alone. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible. | Some people with RA may have intolerance or allergies to certain foods. A balanced nutritious diet is recommended. It may be helpful to eat foods rich in fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Smoking cigarettes should be stopped. Excessive alcohol should also be avoided. | Sometimes, therapists will use special machines to apply deep heat or electrical stimulation to reduce pain and improve joint movement. | RA most often requires long-term treatment by an expert in arthritis called a rheumatologist. Treatment includes: | Physical therapy | Methotrexate is the most commonly used DMARD for rheumatoid arthritis. Leflunomide and hydroxychloroquine may also be used. | Total joint replacement, in extreme cases, may include total knee replacement (TKR) and hip replacement. | Removal of the joint lining (synovectomy) | Heat and cold treatments | Low white blood cell count | Damage to nerves | They may be given when other medicines, usually methotrexate, have not worked.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001526.htm,Autism spectrum disorder,"APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS (ABA) | There is no medicine that treats ASD itself. But medicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with ASD may have. These include: | IfÂ you're thinking about these or other diet changes, talk to both a provider and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure thatÂ your child is still getting enough calories and the right nutrients. | This program is for younger children. ItÂ helps in some cases. ABA uses one-on-one teaching that reinforces various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal functioning for their age. | An ABA program is often done in a child's home. A behavioral psychologist oversees the program. ABA programs can be very expensive and aren't widely used by school systems. Parents often have to find funding and staffing from other sources, which aren't available in many communities. | DIET | Treatment plans may combine techniques, including: | Beware of widely publicized treatments for ASD that don't have scientific support, and reports of miracle cures. If your child has ASD, talk with other parents. Also discuss your concerns with ASD specialists. Follow the progress of ASD research, which is rapidly developing. | MEDICINES | The drug risperidone is FDA approved to treat children ages 5 through 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with ASD. The drug aripriprazole is FDA approved to treat children ages 6 through 17 for the same symptoms. Other medicines that may also be used are mood stabilizers and stimulants. | TEACCH | Another program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). It uses picture schedules and other visual cues. These helpÂ children work on their own and organize and structure their environments. | Some children with ASD seem to do well on a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that changes in diet make a difference. And not all studies have shown positive results. | Though TEACCH tries to improve a child's skills and ability to adapt, it also accepts the problems associated with ASD. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH doesn't expect children to achieve typical development with treatment. | At this time, there is no cure for ASD. A treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children. Most programs build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities. | OTHER APPROACHES | Aggression | Sleep difficulty | Mood swings | Speech-language therapy | Physical therapy | Applied behavior analysis (ABA) | Medicines, if needed | Irritability | Extreme compulsions that the child cannot stop | Anxiety | Attention problems | Impulsiveness | Occupational therapy | Tantrums | Hyperactivity | Outbursts","Social interaction problems may include: | Most parents of children with ASD suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old. Children with ASD often have problems with: | Behaviors may include: | Response to sensory information problems may include: | Some children seem normal before age 1 or 2. They then suddenly lose language or social skills they already had. | Problems with play may include: | Communication problems may include: | Symptoms can vary from moderate to severe. | A person with ASD may: | Social interaction problems may include: | Most parents of children with ASD suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old.

Some scientists believe that damage to a part of the brain, called the amygdala, may be involved. Others are looking at whether a virus may trigger symptoms. | The exact cause of ASD isn't known. It's likely that a number of factors may lead to ASD. Research shows that genes may be involved, since ASD runs in some families. Certain medicines taken during pregnancy may also lead to ASD in the child. | Some parents have heard that vaccines may cause ASD. But studies have found no link between vaccines and ASD. All expert medical and government groups state that there is no link between vaccines and ASD. | The increase in children with ASD may be due to better diagnosis and newer definitions of ASD.

You should avoid further exposure to the substance. | In severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills. Your provider will start you on a high dose and your dose will be slowly reduced over about 12 days. You may also receive a corticosteroid shot. | DO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than your provider advises you to use it. | Topical means you place it on the skin.

This can make it even harder for the body to absorb nutrients. | Most of the time, unlike the large intestine, the small intestine does not have a large number of bacteria. Excess bacteria in the small intestine may use up the nutrients needed by the body. As a result, a person may become malnourished. | Complications of diseases or surgery that create pouches or blockages in the small intestine. Crohn disease is one of these conditions. | Immunodeficiency, such as AIDS or immunoglobulin deficiency. | Some cases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). | Small bowel diverticulosis, in which small, or, at times, large sacs occur in the wall of the intestine. These sacs allow too many bacteria to grow. | Diseases that lead to decreased movement of the small bowel, such as diabetes and scleroderma. | Short bowel syndrome caused by surgical removal of the small intestine. | Surgical procedures that create a loop of small intestine where excess bacteria can grow.

The rest of the veins that carry blue blood from the body (the inferior vena cava) are connected directly to the blood vessels to the lungs. The right ventricle now serves only as the pumping chamber for the body (no longer the lungs and the body). This surgery is usually performed when the baby is 18 months to 4 years old. After this final step, the child is no longer cyanotic and has a normal oxygen level in the blood. | During stages I and II, the child may still appear somewhat blue (cyanotic). | Stage II of the operation is called the Glenn shunt or hemi-Fontan procedure. It is also referred to as a cavopulmonary shunt. This procedure connects the major vein carrying the blood that is depleted of oxygen from the top half of the body (the superior vena cava) directly to blood vessels to the lungs (pulmonary arteries) to get oxygen. The surgery is most often done when the child is 4 to 6 months of age. | Once the diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart is made, the baby will be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. A breathing machine (ventilator) may be needed to help the baby breathe. A medicine called prostaglandin E1 is used to keep blood circulating to the body by keeping the ductus arteriosus open. | The first surgery, called the Norwood operation, occurs within the baby's first few days of life. The Norwood procedure consists of building a new aorta by: | Some doctors consider heart transplantation an alternative to the 3 step surgery. But there are few donated hearts available for small infants. | Afterward, the baby goes home in most cases. The child will need to take daily medicines and be closely followed by a pediatric cardiologist, who will determine when the second stage of surgery should be done. | Some people may need more surgeries in their 20s or 30s if they develop hard to control arrhythmias or other complications of the Fontan procedure. | These measures do not solve the problem. The condition always requires surgery. | A variation of the Norwood procedure, called the Sano procedure, may be used.

Some children may need to stay in the hospital if their breathing problems do not improve after being observed in the clinic or emergency room. | At home, measures to relieve symptoms can be used. For example: | Antibiotics do not work against viral infections. Medicines that treat viruses may be used to treat very ill children. | Have your child drink plenty of fluids. Breast milk or formula is fine for children younger than 12 months. Electrolyte drinks, such as Pedialyte, are also OK for infants. | Have your child breathe moist (wet) air to help loosen sticky mucus. Use a humidifier to moisten the air. | Give your child saline nose drops. Then use a nasal suction bulb to help relieve a stuffy nose. | Be sure your child gets plenty of rest.","Symptoms include: | Some children have few or mild symptoms. | Bronchiolitis begins as a mild upper respiratory infection.

The cause must be treated to prevent the disease from returning. | Positioning or bracing may be used to reduce or prevent deformities. Some skeletal deformities may require surgery to correct them. | Exposure to moderate amounts of sunlight is encouraged. If rickets is caused by a metabolic problem, a prescription for vitamin D supplements may be needed. | Replacing calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D that is lacking will eliminate most symptoms of rickets.

Human breast milk does not supply the proper amount of vitamin D. This can be a particular problem for darker-skinned children in winter months. This is because there are lower levels of sunlight during these months. | Rickets is rare in the United States. It is most likely to occur in children during periods of rapid growth. This is the age when the body needs high levels of calcium and phosphate. Rickets may also be seen in children ages 6 to 24 months. It is uncommon in newborns. | Not getting enough calcium and phosphorous in your diet can also lead to rickets. Rickets caused by a lack of these minerals in the diet is rare in developed countries. Calcium and phosphorous are found in milk and green vegetables. | Disorders that reduce the digestion or absorption of fats will make it more difficult for vitamin D to be absorbed into the body. | Vitamin D helps the body control calcium and phosphate levels. If the blood levels of these minerals become too low, the body may produce hormones that cause calcium and phosphate to be released from the bones. This leads to weak and soft bones. | Your genes may increase your risk for rickets. Hereditary rickets is a form of the disease that is passed down through families. It occurs when the kidneys are unable to hold onto the mineral phosphate. Rickets may also be caused by kidney disorders that involve renal tubular acidosis. | Sometimes, rickets may occur in children who have disorders of the liver. These children cannot convert vitamin D to its active form. | Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D production by the skin may occur in people who: | You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you: | Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight | Must stay indoors | Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products) | Follow a vegetarian diet | Work indoors during the daylight hours | DO NOT drink milk products",Osteomalacia in children; Vitamin D deficiency; Renal rickets; Hepatic rickets,"- Bone pain or tenderness in arms, legs, pelvis, and spine

Infants who were born early or at a low weight, whose mothers had diabetes, or who have other complications/problems may need to be treated for a longer period of time. | Infants with a low blood sugar level will need to receive extra feedings with mother's milk or formula. Babies who are breast-fed may need to receive extra formula if the mother is not able to produce enough milk. (Hand expression and massage can help mothers express more milk.) A sugar gel may be given by mouth temporarily if there is not enough milk. | If the low blood sugar continues, in rare cases, the baby may also receive medicine to increase blood sugar level. In very rare cases, newborns with very severe hypoglycemia who do not improve with treatment may need surgery to remove part of the pancreas (to reduce insulin production). | The infant may need a sugar solution given through a vein (intravenously) if unable to eat by mouth, if the blood sugar does not improve with feeding, or if the blood sugar level is very low.","Also, blood sugar level is usually checked for babies with these symptoms: | Infants with low blood sugar may not have symptoms.

The area where the leak occurred may be repaired. Sometimes, a special chemical is placed into the area of the collapsed lung. This chemical causes a scar to form. This procedure is called pleurodesis. | A small pneumothorax may go away on its own over time. You may only need oxygen treatment and rest. | If you have a large pneumothorax, a chest tube will be placed between the ribs into the space around the lungs to help drain the air and allow the lung to re-expand. The chest tube may be left in place for several days and you may need to stay in the hospital. If a small chest tube or flutter valve is used, you may be able to go home. You will need to return to the hospital to have the tube or valve removed. | Some people with a collapsed lung need extra oxygen. | The provider may use a needle to allow the air to escape from around the lung so it can expand more fully. You may be allowed to go home if you live near the hospital.","Common symptoms of a collapsed lung include: | A larger pneumothorax causes more severe symptoms, including: | Common symptoms of a collapsed lung include: | A larger pneumothorax causes more severe symptoms, including: | Chest tightness | Bluish color of the skin due to lack oxygen Nasal flaring (from shortness breath) Shock and collapse Shortness breath Lightheadedness near fainting Easy fatigue Sharp chest or shoulder pain, made worse by a deep cough Rapid heart rate Abnormal breathing patterns increased effort","Tall, thin people and smokers are more at risk for a collapsed lung. | In some cases, a collapsed lung occurs without any cause. This is called a spontaneous collapsed lung or spontaneous pneumothorax. | In some cases, a collapsed lung is caused by air blisters of the lung (blebs) that break open, sending air into the space around the lung.

This type of surgery may reduce the number and severity of urinary tract infections. | If needed, people will be treated for chronic kidney disease. | Controlling blood pressure is the most important way to slow kidney damage. Your health care provider may prescribe medicines to control high blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are often used. | Surgery is usually only used in children who have not responded to medical therapy. | Vesicoureteral reflux is separated into five different grades. Simple or mild reflux often falls into grade I or II. The severity of the reflux and amount of damage to the kidney help determine treatment. | More severe vesicoureteral reflux may need surgery, especially in children who do not respond to medical therapy. Surgery to place the ureter back into the bladder (ureteral reimplantation) can stop reflux nephropathy in some cases. | Simple, uncomplicated vesicoureteral reflux (called primary reflux) can be treated with: | Antibiotics taken every day to prevent urinary tract infections | Yearly ultrasound of the kidneys | Repeated urine cultures | Careful monitoring of kidney function","If symptoms do occur, they might be similar to those of: | Some people have no symptoms of reflux nephropathy.

This is called reflux nephropathy. | Risk factors for reflux nephropathy include: | But in some people, urine flows back up to the kidney. This is called vesicoureteral reflux. | Reflux nephropathy can also occur from swelling of the ureters after a kidney transplant or from injury to the ureter. | Urine flows from each kidney through tubes called ureters and into the bladder. When the bladder is full, it squeezes and sends the urine out through the urethra. No urine should flow back into the ureter when the bladder is squeezing. Each ureter has a one-way valve where it enters the bladder that prevents urine from flowing back up the ureter. | Reflux can occur in people whose ureters do not attach properly to the bladder or whose valves do not work well. Children may be born with this problem or may have other birth defects of the urinary system that cause reflux nephropathy. | Reflux nephropathy can occur with other conditions that lead to a blockage of urine flow, including: | Bladder outlet obstruction, such as an enlarged prostate in men | Personal or family history of vesicoureteral reflux | Neurogenic bladder, which can occur in people with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diabetes, or other nervous system (neurological) conditions | Repeat urinary tract infections | Abnormalities of the urinary tract | Bladder stones",Chronic atrophic pyelonephritis; Vesicoureteric reflux; Nephropathy - reflux; Ureteral reflux,"- Symptoms of reflux nephropathy may be similar to those of chronic kidney failure and urinary tract infection
